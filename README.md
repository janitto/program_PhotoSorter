# PhotoSorter
Hello,

this is program for searching in photos under "ParickovaPhotos" for faces from "ParickovaFaces". 
Result are new directories for each template face containing images where that face is located.

**Step 1:** Upload photos (e.g. from latest trip) to folder "ParickovaPhotos"  
**Step 2:** Snip the faces of participants from that photos and save each face (+ face per person) under its name to folder "ParickovaFaces"  
**Step 3:** Run script Parickova.py  

Ordered photos will be under newly created directories.

Good luck and have fun!
